# Getting Started

Portless replaces port numbers with stable, named `.localhost` URLs for local development. For humans and agents.

```diff
- "dev": "next dev"              # http://localhost:3000
+ "dev": "portless myapp next dev"  # http://myapp.localhost:1355
```

## Install

```bash
npm install -g portless
```

> Install globally. Do not add as a project dependency or run via npx.

## Run your app

```bash
portless myapp next dev
# -> http://myapp.localhost:1355
```

The proxy auto-starts when you run an app. A random port (4000--4999) is assigned via the `PORT` environment variable, which most frameworks (Next.js, Vite, etc.) respect automatically.

## Use in package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "portless myapp next dev"
  }
}
```

## Subdomains

Organize services with subdomains:

```bash
portless api.myapp pnpm start
# -> http://api.myapp.localhost:1355

portless docs.myapp next dev
# -> http://docs.myapp.localhost:1355
```

## How it works

Portless runs a reverse proxy on port 1355. Each app registers a route mapping its hostname to an assigned port. Requests to `http://<name>.localhost:1355` are proxied to the app.

```
Browser (myapp.localhost:1355) -> proxy (port 1355) -> App (random port)
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- macOS or Linux
