# Commands

## Run an app

```bash
portless <name> <cmd> [args...]
```

Starts your command and maps it to `http://<name>.localhost:1355`. Auto-starts the proxy if needed.

```bash
portless myapp next dev
portless api pnpm start
portless docs.myapp next dev
```

## List routes

```bash
portless list
```

Shows active routes and their assigned ports.

## Trust the CA

```bash
sudo portless trust
```

Adds the portless certificate authority to your system trust store. Required once for HTTPS with auto-generated certs.

## Proxy control

### Start

```bash
portless proxy start
```

| Flag                  | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --port <number>` | Proxy port (default: 1355). Below 1024 requires sudo. |
| `--https`             | Enable HTTP/2 + TLS with auto-generated certs         |
| `--cert <path>`       | Custom TLS certificate (implies `--https`)            |
| `--key <path>`        | Custom TLS private key (implies `--https`)            |
| `--no-tls`            | Disable HTTPS (overrides `PORTLESS_HTTPS`)            |
| `--foreground`        | Run in foreground instead of daemon mode              |

### Stop

```bash
portless proxy stop
```

## Bypass portless

```bash
PORTLESS=0 pnpm dev
```

Runs the command directly without the proxy. Also accepts `PORTLESS=skip`.

## Info

```bash
portless --help
portless --version
```
